# Workday-Scheduler 

# Description 

For this assignment, I have created a scheduling application that allows users to enter data into each hour of the day. Data entered is stored locally, and makes sure data remains on page even if it's refreshed. 

Using dayjs(), the timeblock is color coded based on the current hour.
